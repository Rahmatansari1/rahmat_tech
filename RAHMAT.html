                    <p> Luxury Maldives Holidays and Vacations
                        The term tropical beach paradise was probably coined with the Maldives in mind. This
                        secluded
                        Indian
                        Ocean haven, lying southwest of India and Sri Lanka, is as gorgeous undersea as it is above.

                        Underwater, a clown triggerfish darts past while you’re focusing on a school of
                        three-striped
                        damselfish. A stingray glides along the sandy sea floor, while a slender yellow trumpetfish
                        disappears
                        into the boulder coral nearby. Snorkeling with a busy bunch of neon fish surely rates among
                        life’s
                        most
                        joyful experiences.
                        Settled in the core of the Indian Ocean, the Maldives is an assortment of 26 atolls
                        containing
                        more
                        than 1,000 coral islands. An objective encapsulates the possibility of heaven, with its
                        perfect
                        white sandy sea shores, completely clear turquoise waters, and lively marine life. In any
                        case,
                        past
                        its beautiful scenes, the Maldives offers a special social embroidery and a lifestyle that
                        is
                        profoundly entwined with the rhythms of the sea and the customs of its kin.

                        My excursion to the Maldives was completely a little glimpse of heaven. From the moment I
                        ventured
                        off the plane onto the smooth landing area of Malé International Airport, I was encompassed
                        in
                        the
                        warm hug of the tropical air and the substantial feeling of serenity that penetrates the
                        islands.

                    <p> Most of Bali is mountainous (essentially an extension of the central mountain chain in Java),
                        the highest point being Mount Agung, or Bali Peak, 10,308 feet (3,142 metres) in height and
                        known locally as the “navel of the world.” It proved to be an active volcano, erupting in 1963
                        (after a dormancy of 120 years), killing more than 1,500 persons and leaving thousands homeless.
                        The main lowland is south of the central mountains. The period of the southeast monsoon (May to
                        November) is the dry season. Bali’s flora (mostly hilly tropical rain forest) and fauna resemble
                        those of Java. Some teak grows on Bali, and the giant banyan (waringin) trees are held sacred by
                        the Balinese. Tigers are found in the west, and deer and wild pigs are numerous.

                        Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, an area with high diversity of marine species, especially
                        fish and
                        turtles.[18] In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found.
                        The
                        confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses, which originated before
                        Dutch
                        colonisation, are not recognised by the government of Indonesia</p>

                                Mauritius is one of the preferred destinations for avid divers and fans of underwater
                                discoveries. The reason is simple: the biodiversity in the lagoons of the island and its
                                surroundings is exceptional, you can discover numerous species including beautiful
                                coral, fish, and shellfish whose colors and behaviors that are as varied as strange.

                                Feel free to discover the coral garden, located off the small town of Peyrebere, to
                                observe sea robins, or to photograph the famous lion fish or the beautiful angel fish.
                                In Mauritian waters you will also find the stone-fish, stealthy and difficult to detect,
                                known for their ability to camouflage and Java moray south of the island, towards
